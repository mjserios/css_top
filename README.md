# css_top
Project for The Odin Project's CSS module

In this project, I will create my own website by incorporating the skills that I learned in the TOP's HTML and CSS module. I'll be using the HTML for creating the basic layout/foundation for the website and use CSS to decorate and copy the style of the provided template.
